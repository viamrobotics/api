/**
 * #### Introduction
 *
 * The Byte Stream API enables a client to read and write a stream of bytes to
 * and from a resource. Resources have names, and these names are supplied in
 * the API calls below to identify the resource that is being read from or
 * written to.
 *
 * All implementations of the Byte Stream API export the interface defined here:
 *
 * * `Read()`: Reads the contents of a resource.
 *
 * * `Write()`: Writes the contents of a resource. The client can call `Write()`
 *   multiple times with the same resource and can check the status of the write
 *   by calling `QueryWriteStatus()`.
 *
 * #### Service parameters and metadata
 *
 * The ByteStream API provides no direct way to access/modify any metadata
 * associated with the resource.
 *
 * #### Errors
 *
 * The errors returned by the service are in the Google canonical error space.
 *
 * @generated from protobuf service google.bytestream.ByteStream
