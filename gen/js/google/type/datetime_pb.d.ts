/**
 * Represents civil time (or occasionally physical time).
 *
 * This type can represent a civil time in one of a few possible ways:
 *
 *  * When utc_offset is set and time_zone is unset: a civil time on a calendar
 *    day with a particular offset from UTC.
 *  * When time_zone is set and utc_offset is unset: a civil time on a calendar
 *    day in a particular time zone.
 *  * When neither time_zone nor utc_offset is set: a civil time on a calendar
 *    day in local time.
 *
 * The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar.
 *
 * If year is 0, the DateTime is considered not to have a specific year. month
 * and day must have valid, non-zero values.
 *
 * This type may also be used to represent a physical time if all the date and
 * time fields are set and either case of the `time_offset` oneof is set.
 * Consider using `Timestamp` message for physical time instead. If your use
 * case also would like to store the user's timezone, that can be done in
 * another field.
 *
 * This type is more flexible than some applications may want. Make sure to
 * document and validate your application's limitations.
