/* Pose is a combination of location and orientation.
Location is expressed as distance which is represented by x , y, z coordinates. Orientation is expressed as an orientation vector which
is represented by o_x, o_y, o_z and theta. The o_x, o_y, o_z coordinates represent the point on the cartesian unit sphere that the end of
the arm is pointing to (with the origin as reference). That unit vector forms an axis around which theta rotates. This means that
incrementing / decrementing theta will perform an inline rotation of the end effector.
Theta is defined as rotation between two planes: the first being defined by the origin, the point (0,0,1), and the rx, ry, rz point, and the
second being defined by the origin, the rx, ry, rz point and the local Z axis. Therefore, if theta is kept at zero as the north/south pole
is circled, the Roll will correct itself to remain in-line. */
